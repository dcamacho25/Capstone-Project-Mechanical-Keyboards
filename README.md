# Mechanical Keyboards Informational Site

This site is supposed to be a guide to newcomers of the mechanical keyboard community so they can explore the options of mechanical switches that they have available. I will be expanding upon this site as my coding skills improve so that I can cover more information in a better layout in the future.
Below you will find the CSS and Javscript features I have used so far.

##CSS
- Flexbox is used to style my main header class to have even space between the logo and the list of switch types. It is also used within my media queries to create 2 columns on tablet sized screens.
- nth-of-type is implemented to change the color of every other <article> tag

##Javascript
The "More" button on the main header is used to expand the list in the header. 
The form at the bottom of my page will validate if text has been input and report back with an error message in case nothing has been typed before submitting. I also used to regex to check if integers were used in the form along with a string.
